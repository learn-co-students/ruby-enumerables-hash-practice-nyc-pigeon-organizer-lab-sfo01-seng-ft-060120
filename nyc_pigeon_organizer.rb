# first off we create a new hash to store our data in.
# is our data hash we must iterate over the :color, :gender: and :lives -- i.e (color_gender_live); along with their key/value pairs i.e(info)
#we then want to iterate over our info(keys) and find the array of igeon names(names) inside of them.
# we then want to iterate through the names(name)  because we will then be able to grab each pigeon name individually.

# then we ask --> if the there are no pigeon names in our empty hash, we must return an empty hash with each name of that pigeon creating their own empty hashes
# then we ask --> if there are no pigeon names key and the color/gender/live key for our empty hash, we must assign and return it as an empty array.
# lastly, we want to append to our pigeon_name[names][color_gender_live] its values (the info) into the arrays which are now converted strings

# resulting in returning the new pigeon hash
